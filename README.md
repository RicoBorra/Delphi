## Description
### Delphi
This is a CTF challenge designed for beginners. To use it just run 
```console
$ docker-compose up
```
 and connect to localhost on a browser, alternatively host it on your machine and have friends play it without the sources available!
## Spoilers ahead!
The main purpose of this challenge (aside from having fun) is to accustom the player with byte-by-byte bruteforcing, akin to the "oracle" attacks on block ciphers.
